# This is a project about house price prediction. 
# Repository is included the data set, two kind of version of the code(py file and jupyter file)

# Introduction
We are first year graduate students from Macau University of Science and Technology in Macau, China. Our team have three members: Yin Zexi; Wang Mingpei and Wang Kaige. 

# Data Source
In this study, a modified version of the California Housing dataset available from Lu√≠s Torgo's page (University of Porto) was selected as the data for our study after several screenings by our team.This dataset appeared in a 1997 paper titled Sparse Spatial Autoregressions by Pace, R. Kelley and Ronald Barry, published in the Statistics and Probability Letters journal. They built it using the 1990 California census data. It contains one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).

# Abstract
In the study, we will first clean and visualize the data, then use machine learning models such as linear regression, logistic regression and XGBoost for house price prediction, and optimize XGBoost by Bayesian conditioning, then compare the four models to find the optimal model for this house price prediction problem, and use SHAP to explain the contribution of the model parameters.
